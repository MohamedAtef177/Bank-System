Introduction
Welcome to the Bank System End-to-End Project repository. This project showcases a comprehensive data warehousing solution tailored for a banking system. It covers the entire lifecycle from data extraction to analysis and reporting, leveraging advanced technologies and methodologies.

Project Phases
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Data is extracted from various sources, transformed to meet data warehousing requirements, and loaded into a structured data warehouse.
Analysis: Data is modeled and structured for efficient querying and analysis using SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) or similar tools.
Reporting: Insights and trends are visualized through reporting tools like Power BI or Tableau, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.
Data Source
The source dataset for this project consists of transactional data from the bank's systems, capturing customer interactions, transactions, account details, and more.

Technologies Used
SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for ETL processes
SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) for data modeling and analysis
Power BI or Tableau for visualization and reporting
